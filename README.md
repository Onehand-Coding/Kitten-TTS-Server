## üó£Ô∏è Overview: Enhanced KittenTTS Generation

The [KittenTTS model by KittenML](https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS) provides a foundation for generating high-quality speech from a model smaller than 25MB. This project elevates that foundation into a production-ready service by providing a robust [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) server that makes KittenTTS significantly easier to use, more powerful, and drastically faster.

We solve the complexity of setting up and running the model by offering:

*   A **modern Web UI** for easy experimentation, preset loading, and speed adjustment.
*   Optional **GPU Acceleration** for NVIDIA GPUs via extras (see installation).
*   **Large Text Handling & Audiobook Generation:** Intelligently splits long texts into manageable chunks, processes them sequentially, and seamlessly concatenates the audio. Perfect for creating complete audiobooks.
*   **A flexible, dual-API system** including a simple endpoint and an OpenAI-compatible endpoint for easy integration.
*   **Built-in Voices:** A fixed list of 8 ready-to-use voices for consistent and reliable output.
*   **Cross-platform support** for Windows and Linux, with clear setup instructions.
*   Simple local install (no Docker files in this repo).

## üçì Raspberry Pi & Edge Device Support

The ultra-lightweight nature of the KittenTTS model and the efficiency of this server make it a perfect candidate for running on single-board computers (SBCs) and other edge devices.

*   ‚úÖ **Raspberry Pi 5 (RP5):** Confirmed to run with **excellent performance**. The server is fast and responsive, easily handling requests from other devices on the same local network (LAN). This makes it ideal for local network services, home automation, and other DIY projects.

*   ‚è≥ **Raspberry Pi 4 (RP4):** Testing is currently in progress. Not working on the 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS.

To install, simply follow the standard **Linux installation guide** provided in this README.

## üî• Optional GPU Acceleration

By default the server runs on CPU-only dependencies for broad compatibility. If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want acceleration, install the optional GPU extras described below.

## üîÑ Alternative to Piper TTS

The [KittenTTS model](https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS) serves as an excellent alternative to [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) for fast generation on limited compute and edge devices like Raspberry Pi 5.

**KittenTTS Model Advantages:**
- **Extreme Efficiency**: Just 15 million parameters and under 25MB, significantly smaller than most Piper models
- **Universal Compatibility**: CPU-optimized to run without GPU on any device and "works literally everywhere"
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for real-time speech synthesis even on resource-constrained hardware

**This Server Project's Enhancement:**
While KittenTTS provides the ultra-lightweight foundation, this server transforms it into a production-ready Piper replacement by adding GPU acceleration (unavailable in the base model), modern REST/OpenAI APIs, audiobook processing capabilities, and an intuitive web interface‚Äîall while maintaining the model's edge device compatibility.

Perfect for users seeking Piper's offline capabilities with better performance on limited hardware and modern server infrastructure.

## üìñ API Documentation

The server exposes two main endpoints for TTS. See `http://localhost:8005/docs` for an interactive playground.

### Primary Endpoint: `/tts`

This endpoint offers the most control.

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "text": "Hello from the KittenTTS API!",
      "voice": "expr-voice-5-m",
      "speed": 1.0,
      "output_format": "mp3",
      "split_text": true,
      "chunk_size": 300
    }
    ```
*   **Response:** Streaming audio file (`audio/wav`, `audio/mp3`, etc.).

### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint: `/v1/audio/speech`

Use this for drop-in compatibility with scripts expecting OpenAI's TTS API structure.

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "model": "kitten-tts",
      "input": "This is an OpenAI-compatible request.",
      "voice": "expr-voice-4-f",
      "response_format": "wav",
      "speed": 0.9
    }
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All server settings are managed in the `configs/config.yaml` file. It's created automatically on first launch if it doesn't exist.

**Key Settings:**
*   `server.host`, `server.port`: Network settings.
*   `tts_engine.device`: Set to `auto`, `cuda`, or `cpu`. The server will use your GPU if set to `auto` or `cuda` and a compatible environment is found.
*   `generation_defaults.speed`: Default speech speed (1.0 is normal).
*   `audio_output.format`: Default audio format (`wav`, `mp3`, `opus`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

*   **Phonemizer / eSpeak Errors:**
    *   This is the most common issue. Ensure you have installed **eSpeak NG** correctly for your OS and **restarted your terminal** afterward. The server includes auto-detection logic for common install paths.
*   **GPU Not Used (if you installed GPU extras):**
    *   Ensure you installed CUDA-enabled PyTorch wheels and the `[gpu]` extra.
    *   Verify with `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`.
*   **"No module named 'soundfile'" or Audio Errors on Linux:**
    *   The underlying system library is likely missing. Run `sudo apt install libsndfile1`.
*   **"Port already in use" Error:**
*   Another application is using port 8005. Stop that application or change the port in `configs/config.yaml` (e.g., `port: 8006`) and restart the server.
